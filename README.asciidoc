= Life Tips

This book is an ongoing collection of life lessons aqcuired from personal experiences and from books and quotes by wiser people that have been in this planet before me.

I believe I've had an excellent run in life so far, I've been lucky enough to over achieve my dreams, I started writing these tips since 2017 on a moleskine notebook when I was 37 years old and a lot has happened ever since.

As of May 2022 I am 42 years old and every tip I wrote back in 2017 has been reaffirmed and used ever since. During the last 5 years more lessons have come by and now that my kids are old enough to understand and start making use of these tips, it is time to turn the list into a short formal manuscript which will be maintained by me for as long as I live.

The last 2 years I've focused on learning more about people through books and closer observation of human behavior and the fascinating concept of the ego and how it can be used to 'hack' people. 

Raising my kids has shined a light on my own social challenges and I have a high degree of certainty that I'm somewhere in the autistic spectrum after learning more about the subject. Autism is a condition that has perhaps been a gift when it comes to deep thinking, creativity, imagination, productivity and money making, but it's been a disadvantage when dealing with people when it's truly necessary to do so, in personal relationships, courting others, saying the right thing at the right time, social popularity, leadership. I've learned not to dismiss the importance of socio-emotional  and social capital, aspects I used to be very dismissive of.

I'm not a person guided by gut feelings, gods, spirits nor magical thinking.
Perhaps it's only around me, but those I know are guided primarily by their instincts tend to live in a world of chaos and never ending drama, they never seem to have their shit together, while for me, things tend to line up more easily, perhaps I've been lucky the past 20 years, perhaps living by good principles just makes sense.

Life doesn't need to be that hard if you follow sound principles and act based on facts and logic.

This is for you Nicole, Sarah and Desmond.
